				<h3>What is nwHacks?</h3>
				<p>
					nwHacks is one of the biggest student-run hackathons in the Pacific Northwest. It creates a fun and awesome venue for coding while bringing together the wide student community of expert developers and developers-to-be.
				</p>
				
				<h4>That’s great and all but what do you actually do in a “hackathon” anyway?</h4>
				<p>
					No, it’s not what you think - you’re not going to try and access your friend's Facebook account. Instead, you’ll be doing something better and far more interesting! In a span of 36 hours, you will be collaborating with a team of 2-5 people in developing an app!
				</p>
				
				<h4>Developing an app??? But I don’t even know a thing or two about coding!</h4>
				<p>
					Doesn’t matter! We've got your back! We’ll make sure to put you in a team where an experienced developer could guide you. All you really need is your laptop, overnight stuff, and your thinking cap! Nothing else.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="question grid-100 tablet-grid-75">
				<h3>Who participates in this?</h3>
				<p>
					Apart from <strong>YOU</strong>? Why, all the best students who have a budding interest in tech, of course! Students anywhere from Arts to Engineering, Commerce to Science, Forestry to Kinesiology are all welcome to nwHacks, whether it’s their first time coding or feel like they’ve done it one too many times!
				<br>
					<i>If you are a college dropout or a highschooler, please email us at apps@nwhacks.com to apply.</i>
				</p>
	
				<h4>What if I’ve already graduated?</h4>
				<p>Although you can no longer join as a participant, you are always welcome to be a mentor! </p>

				<h3>What kinds of things will people build?</h3>
				<p>Software as hardware (please expand on this)</p>
			</h3>
			
			
			<div class="question grid-100 tablet-grid-75">
				<h3>You mentioned there would be prizes… can you tell me more about that?</h3>
				<p>That’s something you’d have to find out for yourself by going to the event! While everyone is a winner, we would still have to recognize the team with the most creative, polished and theme-specific projects or to call it simply, “hacks.”</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="question grid-100 tablet-grid-75">
				<h3>Can I work on a current project?</h3>
				
				<p>The point of this hackathon is for you to come up with a hack together with your team in a race against the clock. So to answer your question, unfortunately, you may not.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="question grid-100 tablet-grid-75">
				<h3>When and where is it going to be held?</h3>
				
				<p>It’ll be in the Life Sciences Centre in UBC! We're still finalizing the date, but it will be in Early March or Late Feburary. Stay tuned for an annoucement on this!</p>
		
				<h4>Sounds good! Where do I sign up?</h4>
				
				<p>Love the enthusiasm! Too bad the official registration isn’t open yet. But hey, you can always shoot us an email /here/ to get updates!
