				<h3>Why <em>nw</em>Hacks?</h3>
	
				<p>British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, and Alberta are currently seen as transit stations for tech companies. Designers, engineers, and business minds all flow down to California and shortly after university graduation. We want to change that.
				<br>
				<br>
				nwHacks is dedicated to creating a thriving community of technology lovers in the Pacific Northwest region by bringing together the brightest minds for an epic two day event.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>What is a "hackathon"?</h3>
	
				<p>A hackathon is an event where teams of 2-5 people collaborate on an application within the specified time
					limit (nwHacks is 36 hours long). Prizes are awarded to the most creative, polished and theme-specific
					projects or "hacks". The winners will be chosen by a panel of judges comprised of top industry
					professionals.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>How can I officially sign up?</h3>
	
				<p>Official registration for nwHacks 2015 isn't open yet, but you can submit your email <a href="#hero">here</a>
					to get updates as soon as they arrive.</p>
			</div>
	
		</article>
	
		<article id="faq-students" class="grid-container grid-parent">
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
	
				<p>nwHacks is a 36h event, which means that hackers should be prepared to sleep overnight at the venue.
					Be sure to bring everything you need to stay the night, including a sleeping bag! All food will be
					provided at event so don't worry about that!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
	
				<p>nwHacks is 100% free for all participants. However registration is strictly limited to <b>highschool and
						college students only</b>. We will also reimburse your travel expensives as long as they are not
					flights and are within a 200km radius of the event. We are also setting up buses from Seattle, Portland,
					and Victoria ( maybe Calgary) so definitely check that out as we get closer to the start date!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>Can I work on my previous projects?</h3>
	
				<p>No, all "hacks" must be built from scratch, although it is ok if you came up with the idea before hand.
					This rule is strictly adhered to at nwHacks and any team found working on a project that they already
					started will be automatically disqualified in the event. However this does not apply to any libraries or
					tools that you have made, so feel free to use libraries and anyother code!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>How big can my team be?</h3>
	
				<p>Teams are usually 2-5 people in size. Teams bigger than 5 people are usually split up into smaller ones,
					as we've found large teams aren't the best solution for a 36h event. Don't worry if you can't find your
					team beforehand, staff at the event will help you find other team mates and provide you with many
					opportunities to find others to help!</p>
			</div>
	        <div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
	            <h3>What happens if I don't have a team?</h3>
	
	            <p>Don't worry! A lot of hackers just like you are in the same position. On January 9th, the first day of the event, we will make sure to pair everyone up with a team of hackers so no one gets left out! There will also be an opportunity to connect with people and form teams before the event (after you have been chosen to attend)</p>

				<h3>Does my company have to be based in the Pacific NorthWest to become a sponsor?</h3>
	
				<p>Definitely not! We welcome sponsors from across the world to help with our event, although it generally
					helps if you have an office or presence in the region.</p>
