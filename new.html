				<h3>Why <em>nw</em>Hacks?</h3>
	
				<p>British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, and Alberta are currently seen as transit stations for tech companies. Designers, engineers, and business minds all flow down to California and shortly after university graduation. We want to change that.
				<br>
				<br>
				nwHacks is dedicated to creating a thriving community of technology lovers in the Pacific Northwest region by bringing together the brightest minds for an epic two day event.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>What is a "hackathon"?</h3>
	
				<p>A hackathon is an event where teams of 2-5 people collaborate on an application within the specified time
					limit (nwHacks is 36 hours long). Prizes are awarded to the most creative, polished and theme-specific
					projects or "hacks". The winners will be chosen by a panel of judges comprised of top industry
					professionals.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>How can I officially sign up?</h3>
	
				<p>Official registration for nwHacks 2015 isn't open yet, but you can submit your email <a href="#hero">here</a>
					to get updates as soon as they arrive.</p>
			</div>
	
		</article>
	
		<article id="faq-students" class="grid-container grid-parent">
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
	
				<p>nwHacks is a 36h event, which means that hackers should be prepared to sleep overnight at the venue.
					Be sure to bring everything you need to stay the night, including a sleeping bag! All food will be
					provided at event so don't worry about that!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
	
				<p>nwHacks is 100% free for all participants. However registration is strictly limited to <b>highschool and
						college students only</b>. We will also reimburse your travel expensives as long as they are not
					flights and are within a 200km radius of the event. We are also setting up buses from Seattle, Portland,
					and Victoria ( maybe Calgary) so definitely check that out as we get closer to the start date!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>Can I work on my previous projects?</h3>
	
				<p>No, all "hacks" must be built from scratch, although it is ok if you came up with the idea before hand.
					This rule is strictly adhered to at nwHacks and any team found working on a project that they already
					started will be automatically disqualified in the event. However this does not apply to any libraries or
					tools that you have made, so feel free to use libraries and anyother code!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>How big can my team be?</h3>
	
				<p>Teams are usually 2-5 people in size. Teams bigger than 5 people are usually split up into smaller ones,
					as we've found large teams aren't the best solution for a 36h event. Don't worry if you can't find your
					team beforehand, staff at the event will help you find other team mates and provide you with many
					opportunities to find others to help!</p>
			</div>
	        <div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
	            <h3>What happens if I don't have a team?</h3>
	
	            <p>Don't worry! A lot of hackers just like you are in the same position. On January 9th, the first day of the event, we will make sure to pair everyone up with a team of hackers so no one gets left out! There will also be an opportunity to connect with people and form teams before the event (after you have been chosen to attend)</p>

				<h3>What is nwHacks?</h3>
				<p>
					nwHacks is one of the biggest student-run hackathons in the Pacific Northwest. It creates a fun and awesome venue for coding while bringing together the wide student community of expert developers and developers-to-be.
				</p>
				
				<h4>That’s great and all but what do you actually do in a “hackathon” anyway?</h4>
				<p>
					No, it’s not what you think - you’re not going to try and access your friend's Facebook account. Instead, you’ll be doing something better and far more interesting! In a span of 36 hours, you will be collaborating with a team of 2-5 people in developing an app!
				</p>
				
				<h4>Developing an app??? But I don’t even know a thing or two about coding!</h4>
				<p>
					Doesn’t matter! We've got your back! We’ll make sure to put you in a team where an experienced developer could guide you. All you really need is your laptop, overnight stuff, and your thinking cap! Nothing else.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="question grid-100 tablet-grid-75">
				<h3>Who participates in this?</h3>
				<p>
					Apart from <strong>YOU</strong>? Why, all the best students who have a budding interest in tech, of course! Students anywhere from Arts to Engineering, Commerce to Science, Forestry to Kinesiology are all welcome to nwHacks, whether it’s their first time coding or feel like they’ve done it one too many times!
				
					<h4>If you are a college dropout or a highschooler, please email us at apps@nwhacks.com to apply.</h4>
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="question grid-100 tablet-grid-75">
				<h3>What if I’ve already graduated?</h3>
				<p>Although you can no longer join as a participant, you are always welcome to be a mentor! </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="question grid-100 tablet-grid-75">
				<h3>What kinds of things will people build?</h3>
				<p>Software as hardware (please expand on this)</p>
			</h3>
			
			
			<div class="question grid-100 tablet-grid-75">
				<h3>You mentioned there would be prizes… can you tell me more about that?</h3>
				<p>That’s something you’d have to find out for yourself by going to the event! While everyone is a winner, we would still have to recognize the team with the most creative, polished and theme-specific projects or to call it simply, “hacks.”</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="question grid-100 tablet-grid-75">
				<h3>May I start building before the competition starts then?</h3>
				
				<p>The point of this hackathon is for you to come up with a hack together with your team in a race against the clock. So to answer your question, unfortunately, you may not.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="question grid-100 tablet-grid-75">
				<h3>When and where is it going to be held?</h3>
				
				<p>It’ll be in the Life Sciences Centre in UBC! We're still finalizing the date, but it will be in Early March or Late Feburary. Stay tuned for an annoucement on this!</p>
		
				<h4>Sounds good! Where do I sign up?</h4>
				
				<p>Love the enthusiasm! Too bad the official registration isn’t open yet. But hey, you can always shoot us an email /here/ to get updates!
